in terminal type 

$ mysql-ctl start


IMPORTING DATA INTO YOUR DATABASE
To import existing data into your database run following commands:

Shell
$ mysql-ctl cli

You are now in the MySQL environment and can start the import:

Shell
mysql> use c9
mysql> source source mysql/ballshot.sql
mysql> show tables;

CONNECTING FROM PHP
So now you know how to create a database, start the DB server, and access it via a
command line tool. It's time for the real deal: accessing it from your code.

In this example, we will connect from PHP:

Create a new file and call it connect.php
Copy/paste the following code in there and save the file:


<?php
    // A simple PHP script demonstrating how to connect to MySQL.
    // Press the 'Run' button on the top to start the web server,
    // then click the URL that is emitted to the Output tab of the console.

    $servername = getenv('IP');
    $username = getenv('C9_USER');
    $password = "";
    $database = "c9";
    $dbport = 3306;

    // Create connection
    $db = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database, $dbport);

    // Check connection
    if ($db->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $db->connect_error);
    } 
    echo "Connected successfully (".$db->host_info.")";
?>








After creating the file:

Run the code by right-clicking on the file name from the navigation pane then clicking 'Run'
The output pane (usually on the bottom of your screen) shows 'Starting Apache httpd...'
Click the link that is displayed after that (https://workspacename-username.c9.io/connect.php)
A preview pane will open, showing 'Connected successfully (0.0.0.0 via TCP/IP)'.
 Note

MySQL socket file can be found in ~/lib/mysql/socket/mysql.sock

Can I use my own MySQL credentials?
Yes, this is possible. You can log into MySQL by entering 'mysql-ctl cli' then run the following lines to add a new user:

MySQL
CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Simply replace username / password in the code above with the username / password you want.
